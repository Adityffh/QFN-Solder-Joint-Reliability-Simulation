# ðŸ”© QFN Solder Joint Reliability Simulation (ANSYS)

This repository contains the simulation workflow, models, and analysis results for evaluating the **fatigue reliability of solder joints** in a **Quad Flat No-Leads (QFN)** package under thermal cycling using **ANSYS Mechanical**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the thermo-mechanical reliability of QFN solder joints by:

- Simulating thermal cycling from **âˆ’40Â°C to 100Â°C** at a ramp rate of 10Â°C/min.
- Evaluating three lead-free solder alloys: **SAC105**, **SAC305**, and **SAC405**.
- Comparing fatigue life and plastic deformation using **Garofalo creep** and **Syed fatigue life** models.

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary

| Solder Alloy | Plastic Work | Cycles to Failure | Reliability |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **SAC105**   | 0.0355       | ~1726             | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†       |
| **SAC305**   | 0.0032       | ~78               | â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†       |
| **SAC405**   | 0.0100       | ~3150             | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…       |

- **SAC105** showed the best balance between ductility and fatigue resistance.
- **SAC405**, while stronger due to higher Ag content, exhibited higher brittleness and strain localization.
- **SAC305** had the shortest fatigue life, making it less suitable for high-reliability environments.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Higher silver content increases strength but reduces ductility, affecting solder reliability.
- Accurate material modeling and fatigue prediction is critical in electronics packaging.
- FEA-based fatigue simulation can guide material selection for robust IC design.
